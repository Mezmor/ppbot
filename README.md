# ppbot - a python IRC bot #
# created by billy <billyvg/gmail/com> #

# Information #
This project started as a school assignment which I will continue to
work on for fun... I'm choosing to make pgsql as a requirement because
I want to learn it and move away from mysql. Portability may be 
something that I will worry about later.

# Install #
``pip install -r requirements.txt``
Edit ppbot.cfg
``python db.py``
``python ppbot.py``
